# Multi-level-Keyless-speech-encryption
The exponential developments in the field of communication, data transfer, and computational technologies have created tremendous growth in the development of encryption techniques. In this contest there will always be a healthy demand for efficient and strong encryption techniques to store data in encrypted domain to avoid the possibility of data breach in the shared networks. In this paper, a novel approach for multi-level keyless speech encryption technique based on controlled chaos position transformation and controlled noise generation is developed. In the proposed algorithm, speech sample positions are randomized with the help of controlled chaos position transformation system and then noise is generated in the randomized speech samples with the help of controlled noise generation system. Secret noise generation level of the noise generation system increases the security of the developed algorithm and it is attached in the end of encrypted speech with the help of combinational masking scheme, which makes the developed encryption technique keyless. The developed algorithm is tested over a huge number of speech samples and the obtained result shows improvement in UACI and SNR by 17.4% and 49.29% respectively than the related work found in the literature. The proposed algorithm is compared with different relevant works and found superior to them.
